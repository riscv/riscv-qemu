Notes for RISCV, updated priv spec version
-----------------------------------------------

General
-------
- fpu-custom-riscv aka softfloat is taken directly from spike (riscv-isa-sim)
  the current version is from 0f622f0e89ff62022b59ac0124fcdf8198da020d of
  spike

- update softfloat further when updating toolchain














OLD, left as notes:
-------------------
- In include/exec/cpu-defs.h, CPU_TLB_BITS has been set to zero for
  debugging purposes, increase for performance
    - this sets the TLBs to only hold one entry
